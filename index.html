          Glaciers and ice sheets hold about 69 percent of the world's
          freshwater.

          Just over 96% of the total amount of the world's water is held in its
          oceans, according to Water in Crisis: A Guide to the World's Fresh
          Water Resources via the United States Geological Survey (USGS).
          However, that's primarily saltwater. To find the bulk of the world's
          freshwater you need to trek to the poles, as 68.7% of it is encased in
          ice caps, permanent snow, and glaciers.

          The fastest gust of wind ever recorded on Earth was 253 miles per
          hour.

          Hang on to your hats because this isn't your average wind storm. In
          1996, a tropical cyclone named Olivia hit off the coast of Barrow
          Island, Australia with such a force that it broke an incredible
          record. According to The Weather Channel, "Olivia's eyewall produced
          five extreme three-second wind gusts, the peak of which was a 253 mph
          gust," which blew past the previous wind record of 231 mph set in
          Mount Washington, New Hampshire back in 1934.

        <h4>Recent droughts in Europe were the worst in 2,100 years.</h4>
        <p class="icon"></p>

      <div class="answer">

          Europe has been experiencing serious dry spells and extreme heat since
          2015, which has caused major droughts. Research done led by the
          University of Cambridge (and published on the National Oceanic and
          Atmospheric Administration website) looked at isotopes in the rings of
          old European Oak trees in Central Europe which formed over thousands
          of years to try to pin down the cause. They discovered that the dry
          spells are a "result of human-caused climate change and associated
          shifts in the jet stream," according to EurekAlert!

        <h4>The best place in the world to see rainbows is in Hawaii.</h4>
        <p class="icon"></p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          If you're an avid rainbow gazer and want to get your fill of the
          beautiful phenomenon, look no further than the state of Hawaii. A
          study published by the American Meteorological Society in 2021 noted
          that the area's "mountains produce sharp gradients in clouds and
          rainfall, which are key to abundant rainbow sightings." Air pollution,
          pollen, and a large amount of cresting waves also help to put Hawaii
          at the top of the list when it comes to rainbow quantity and quality.

        <h4>There are fossilized plants in Greenland under 1.4 km of ice.</h4>
        <p class="icon"></p>
      </div>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>
          Around 80 percent of Greenland is covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet,
          which Britannica explains is the "largest and possibly the only relic
          of the Pleistocene glaciations in the Northern Hemisphere." But has it
          always been so icy? Well, at the bottom of a 1.4 km core sample, which
          was taken in 1966 at Camp Century during the Cold War, researchers
          found "well-preserved fossil plants and biomolecules," which means
          that the massive sheet melted and reformed at least once in the last
          million years. Brrrrr!
